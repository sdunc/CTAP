CT Aerial Photography

Written in ~ 2 hours for RACE Coastal Engineering to assist in engineering operations.
Rewritten 9/14/19 without an ugly GUI and to reduce needless geocoding
Needs a google API key to work! 
~100 lines of python

* A simple program to return historical aerial photography.
* Geocoding service is googleV3 but it should be trivial to swap out for nominatim or something

Second update began on 4/11/20 to add a reddit bot and improve runtime with a kdtree.
